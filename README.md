# GeoPromo Classifier
Predicting whether a user is within a restaurant's promo delivery zone (within a 1 km radius) using logistic regression.

This project is my first practice in learning Python and machine learning, especially from Andrew Ngâ€™s course: Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The idea and code were assisted by ChatGPT. I focused on understanding the logic and math flow of logistic regression, from data generation to training and visualizing the decision boundary.

Tools: Python (NumPy, Matplotlib), Google Colab
